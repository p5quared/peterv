You make a change to a library to optimize its performance or clean up technical debt or fix a bug, only to get a bug report: some very large, incomprehensibly opaque test is now failing. Now you have a major debugging job in an unfamiliar code base.  What if I told you that a magic wand exists that can pinpoint the relevant line of code or call stack in that unfamiliar code base?"

  description: "Several years ago, esteemed computer scientist Alan Kay participated in an Ask Me Anything on Hacker News. The dialogue was kicked off by Kay’s provocative musing on the legitimacy of data; not just some data, but the idea of data itself. It was a bit like a physicist asking, “What if gravity is a bad idea?”"

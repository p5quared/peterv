This is my personal site. 

It's really just a vessel to store some information. 

Said information is currently being managed using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/). 

This site is built with SvelteKit and Skeleton!

I've opted for a very minimal design, but I take no credit for the site design; I knew roughly what I wanted but really hated my first rendition so I [browsed around](https://sveltethemes.dev/) until I found a design I liked. I then built it by hand with Skeleton.

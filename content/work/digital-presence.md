I am in the process of designing a digital business card project. Well, really more of a platform for people to design and share a digital presence, that more closely mimics the tried and tested business card format, rather than that of social media (I hate LinkedIn).

In [my latest post on this topic](https://petervaiciulis.com/posts/my-linkedin-replacement), I've discussed, broadly, my thoughts and ideas surrounding this project

When I am ready to go public with this project I will update this post accordingly with greater detail.

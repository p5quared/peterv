*Meditations *is a book containing the thoughts of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. These thoughts are captured through journal entries written by Marcus Aurelius over the course of his life, and mostly pertain to his strong sentiments towards stoicism. There's a lot of great morsels that I found when reading it, however if I'm being honest the book felt somewhat like I imagine someone's best attempt at *tweeting* would be without *Twitter*. This could be due to a number of factors like the translation I had, or my own reading comprehension, but reading some of the passages felt like I was swimming in concrete.

Nonetheless, the book has been on my bucket list of books for a while now, and I am glad to have read it. To me, it is worth skimming through some of the tougher entries and savoring the great morsels that are throughout.

> The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

> I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.

> The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.

> Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present

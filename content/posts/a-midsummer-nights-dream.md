> The course of true love never did run smooth.

*A Midsummer Night's Dream* is a play about love and a scenario so hilarious it would be difficult not to be entertained. The gist of it is that there exists a sort of 'love *quadrilateral'* between two men and two women. This quadrilateral is quite dangerous and everyone finds themselves out in the woods where, in an unrelated storyline, a fairy king is out to play some petty pranks on his fairy queen with a mysterious love potion. The target of this kings potion of course gets confused and suddenly our love quadrilateral is complete chaos. You can't tell me that doesn't sound like a great plot.

I will leave the heavy lifting of the analysis to the [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/a-midsummer-nights-dream/a-midsummer-nights-dream-a-modern-perspective/):

> A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a play about love. It proposes that love is a dream, or perhaps a vision; that it is absurd, irrational, a delusion, or, perhaps, on the other hand, a transfiguration; that it is doomed to be momentary: "So quick bright things come to confusion”.

And my favorite quote:

> Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

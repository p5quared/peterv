> "See this page of paper? It’s blank," Scull said. "That, sir, is the most frightening battlefield in the world: the blank page. I mean to fill this paper with decent sentences, sir—this page and hundreds like it. Let me tell you, Colonel, it’s harder than fighting Lee. Why, it’s harder than fighting Napoleon."

> Larry McMurtry, *Comanche Moon*

I found this on a particularly deep internet dive skimming the Ph.D. thesis of a distinguished engineer at Google.



Another book to add to my reading list.

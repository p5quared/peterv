# Axioms of Life: Comparison

### Definition: Axiom
> An axiom, postulate, or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true,
to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
> The word comes from the Ancient Greek word ἀξίωμα (axíōma),
meaning 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident'.

In our lives, particularly early on, there are many things that we are expected to believe,
often for no reason (if you have not yet experienced such a thing, I'm sure you'll get it when you're older).
On the other hand, as we grow older, I think it should be natural to begin to define our truths ourselves.
This is particularly pertinant when you realize that there is very little that we could ever define as
*objectively* true; truth is what what we believe.

In any case, one of the most important axioms I have decided to accept in life is one that
I discoverd somewhere on the internet years ago: *'you should compare yourself to who you were yesterday,
not who someone else is today'*

While completing my tour of duty at the Borough of Manhattan CC, I was fortunate to have studied a lot of
programming the summer before, and so I was therefore quite ahead of all of my peers in my classes.
I was always happy to help my classmates though by providing what advice I could, sometimes reccomending
libraries to accomplish a certain task or even manual debugging at times.

One thing that really stood out to me was how most of my peers, over time,
developed a sense of near *reverence* for me.
Now, don't get me wrong, I love being revered as much as the next guy, maybe more, but to be honest I began
to feel a little bit embarrased when people would all but grovel to hear my thoughts.
This was certainly not because I thought poorly of them; in reality I was no more than a few months of
heavy self-studying ahead of them in knowledge and skills. Rather, I think I saw too much of myself in them.

Computer Science is field rife with *imposter syndrome*, or the irrational feeling that one's self *does not belong*.
With hundreds of thousands of kids, many extremely gifted and talented, studying computer science, it is extremely
easy to feel inadequate (you will see plenty of evidence of this on online forums).
While my peers look to me, I could just as easily can look at others my age and feel equally or more inadequate.
I'm a college dropout who returned to community college and is going to graduate years behind schedule. Most of my
peers in CS who are my age, even those who are behind, are well ahead of me by most any objective measure.

This is why this axiom is important. It is our own *growth* that should be recognized and appreciated by ourselves;
where we are really doesn't matter. What good does it do to know that somebody else is better than you?
As we see in physics class, all that matters is our perspective; who we are, where we are, or how we are,
must be measured from who we were, where we were, and how we were, if it is to be of any meaning at all.

**Axiom: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today.**

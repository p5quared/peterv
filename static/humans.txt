This site was made by me: the young, up and coming, Peter Vaiciulis. I am a calm person who really wants to get a job as a software engineer and eventually retire to live on a sailboat and sail around the world!! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or just want to chat!
